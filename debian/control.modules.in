Description: Sysprof module for Linux (kernel _KVERS_)
 Sysprof is a sampling CPU profiler that uses a Linux kernel module to profile
 the entire system, not just a single application. Sysprof handles shared
 libraries and applications do not need to be recompiled. In fact they don't
 even have to be restarted.
 .
 This package contains the kernel module compiled for linx _KVERS_ needed by
 sysprof.
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own sysprof-module. The sysprof-module-source package has been
 provided for use with the Debian's module-assistant or kernel-package
 utilities to produce a version of sysprof-module for your kernel.
 .
 You need a linux kernel version 2.6.11 or newer.
