Description: A system-wide linux profiler
 Sysprof is a sampling CPU profiler that uses a Linux kernel module to profile
 the entire system, not just a single application. Sysprof handles shared
 libraries and applications do not need to be recompiled. In fact they don't
 even have to be restarted.
 .
 It has the following features:
  - profiles all running processes, not just a single application
  - has a simple graphical interface
  - shows the time spent in each branch of the call tree
  - profiles can be loaded and saved
 .
 You need the sysprof kernel module (provided in sysprof-module-source) to use
 sysprof.
